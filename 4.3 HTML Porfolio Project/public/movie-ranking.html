<h1>Diegos best albums of the year</h1>
<h2>My top 3 albums</h2>
<hr/>
<h3>Utopia by travis Scott</h3>
<p>
This was such a great album. <br/>
We waited for about 5 years until this album was released and the tracks where really worth it
</p>
<h3>To all my Dawgs by Drake</h3>
<p>
Now this album isnt realized yet but I cant wait for it. <br/>
Will this be Drakes last album?
</p>
<h3>Genesis by Peso Pluma</h3>
<p>
This album was his debute album and it seemed to do great. <br/>
He really showcased his versatility as an artist in this album.
